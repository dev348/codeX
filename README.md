# Code Explanation for Chat Application

## Description

This is a simple chatbot application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It sends user input to a server using the fetch API and returns a response that is displayed on the chat screen. The bot's response is generated by a machine learning model that is hosted on the server.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

## bash

Copy code
git clone [git@github.com:dev348/codeX.git](https://github.com/dev348/codeX.git)
Open the index.html file in your browser.

## Usage

Type a message in the chat input field and hit the Enter key or click the send button to send it to the server.

Wait for the bot's response to be displayed on the chat screen.

## HTML

The HTML code for this application contains a simple form that allows users to enter their messages and submit them. The messages are displayed in a container below the form. The HTML code can be found in the index.html file.

## CSS

The CSS code for this application styles the form and the chat container. It also contains styles for the chat messages. The CSS code can be found in the style.css file.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript code for this application is contained in the index.js file. The code is responsible for handling user input, sending requests to the server, and displaying the bot's response.

### loader() Function

The loader() function is responsible for displaying a loading animation while the bot's response is being fetched from the server. It takes an HTML element as an argument and sets the element's text content to a series of dots that gradually increase in number until there are four dots. Then it resets the text content to an empty string.

### typeText() Function

The typeText() function takes an HTML element and a string as arguments. It types out the string letter by letter in the element, simulating the effect of someone typing a message. It uses a setInterval() function to type one letter at a time.

### generateUniqueId() Function

The generateUniqueId() function generates a unique ID for each bot response message. It concatenates a timestamp, a random number, and a hexadecimal string to create the ID.

### charStripe() Function

The charStripe() function takes three arguments: a boolean value indicating whether the message is from the bot or the user, the message text, and a unique ID for the message. It returns an HTML string that represents a chat message. The function also uses the bot.svg and user.svg images to display the profile picture for the bot and user respectively.

### handleSubmit() Function

The handleSubmit() function is called when the user submits a message through the form. It first creates a chat message for the user and adds it to the chat container. Then, it creates an empty chat message for the bot with a unique ID, adds it to the chat container, and calls the loader() function to display a loading animation in the message.

The function then sends a POST request to the server using fetch(), passing the user's message as the request body. It waits for the response from the server and checks whether the response was successful. If the response was successful, it extracts the bot's response from the response body, types out the message in the chat message element using the typeText() function, and replaces the loading animation.

If the response was unsuccessful, the function displays an error message in the chat message element.

The handleSubmit() function is also called when the user presses the "Enter" key while typing a message in the form.

### Event Listeners

The code sets event listeners for the form's "submit" and "keyup" events. When the form is submitted or the "Enter" key is pressed, the handleSubmit() function is called.
